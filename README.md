Core War was inspired by a malicious virus written in the 80â€™s. To deal with the self-replicating virus Creaper, a white hat hacker invented Reaper. It was a virus designed to spread and eliminate the malware. He fought fire with fire.

This inspired the Canadian mathematician A. K. Dewdney to co-invent the programming game Core War..

You compete by designing viruses to overtake a computer.

You win by protecting your own program and overwriting your opponent's programs. This is all happening on a virtual computer.
